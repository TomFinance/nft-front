            <p>
            Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”), carefully, before using TOMNFT.io (the “Website”) provided by CBNK Ltd.

            TOM MARKETPLACE is always expanding and thus you may see changes to our Services without warning. Due to the evolving nature of technologies and the way we do business, we reserve the right, with or without notice, to modify, suspend, terminate, or discontinue providing any of the Services at any time. We release updates on a regular basis, some of which are not publicly announced. These are done to improve system stability, add new features, allow us time to perform routine maintenance, or comply with applicable law.

            </p>

            <h2 class="text-base">7.3 – NFT PURCHASE LICENSE</h2>
            <p>
            If you sell an NFT through the Website, you grant to the buyer of the NFT a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the NFT, solely for the following purposes: (a) for the buyer’s own personal use; (b) for the purpose of promoting or sharing the buyer’s purchase, ownership, or interest; (c) for the purpose of sharing, promoting, discussing, or commenting on the content to which the NFT is associated; (d) on third party marketplaces, exchanges, platforms, or applications in association with an offer to sell, or trade, the NFT; and (e) within decentralized virtual environments, virtual worlds, virtual galleries, virtual museums, or other navigable and perceivable virtual environments (the “NFT Purchase License”).
            </p>

If you sell or transfer the NFT to another person, this NFT Purchase License will transfer to such other owner or holder of the NFT, and you will no longer have the benefits of such NFT Purchase License. Unless otherwise specified by seller of an NFT in writing, your purchase of an NFT does not give you the right to publicly display, perform, distribute, sell or otherwise reproduce the NFT for any commercial purpose. If you sell an NFT, you agree that you will not have any claims against Company for any breach of these Terms by a purchaser, including if they make commercial use of the related NFT in breach of these Terms.

            You further acknowledge that NFTs may be subject to terms directly between buyers and sellers with respect to the use of the NFT content and benefits associated with a given NFT (“Purchase Terms”) and that such terms may be accessible via a third-party link to an external website. Such a website may include Purchase Terms governing the use of the NFT with which you must comply. You are solely responsible for reviewing such Purchase Terms. TOM MARKETPLACE is not a party to any such Purchase Terms, which are solely between the buyer and seller, who are entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing such Purchase Terms.

            <h2 class="text-base">15 – ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h2>
            <p>
            You understand and agree that you access and use the Website at your own risk. You should carefully consider whether creating, buying, or selling NFTs is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted via the Website and that you have done sufficient research before making any decisions to sell, obtain, transfer, or otherwise interact with any NFTs or accounts/collections.
            </p>
            <p>
            By using the Website, you understand and agree that your access and use of the Website is subject to certain risks including without limitation:
            </p>
            <p>
            Price, liquidity, and scarcity of blockchain assets, including NFTs, are extremely volatile and may be subject to fluctuations;<br/>
            Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect NFTs;<br/>
            Legislative and regulatory changes or actions may adversely affect the use, transfer, and value of NFTs. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, NFTs, cryptocurrency, and other crypto-based items is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Website and the utility of NFTs;<br/>
            NFTs are not legal tender and are not back by any government;<br/>
            Transactions involving NFTs may be irreversible, and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;<br/>
            A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility of NFTs;<br/>
            The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for NFTs, and therefore the value of NFTs is subject to the potential for permanent or total loss of value should the market for NFTs disappear;<br/>
            NFTs are subject to the risk of fraud, counterfeiting, cyber-attacks, risks that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to your third-party wallet or Account, and other technological difficulties which may prevent access to or use of your NFTs;<br/>
            Withdrawal of an NFT to a decentralized digital asset wallet is at your own risk, and the transfer for any NFT to an incorrect digital asset wallet address will result in the irreversible loss of such NFT;<br/>
            Experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain technologies are used by the Website, and such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the operation and effects and risks thereof;<br/>
            The Website uses public peer-to-peer networks, public blockchains, and certain smart contracts and protocols that are not under the control or influence of TOM MARKETPLACE or any of its affiliates and are subject to many risks and uncertainties;<br/>
            Costs and speeds of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems are variable and may increase or decrease dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability to access or use any NFTs associated with the Website;<br/>
            Risks associated with purchasing items associated with content created by third parties through peer-to-peer transactions, including but not limited to, the seller's unknown identity, the seller's right to sell the NFT, the seller’s right to use the Intellectual Property in the underlying content associated with the NFT, the risk of purchasing counterfeit items, mislabeled items, items vulnerable to metadata decay, items on smart contracts with bugs, and items that may become untransferable.
            You understand and agree that the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks are solely your responsibility. This warning and others provided in these Terms do not constitute or imply an ongoing obligation to alert you to all of the potential risks of using or accessing the Website, and acknowledge that this brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with the Website, NFTs, and other digital assets.
            </p>
            <p>
            YOU RELEASE US AND THE TOM MARKETPLACE PARTIES FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.

            </p>
            <p>
            You waive any and all objections to the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over you and over the subject matter by such courts and to venue in such courts including any defense of forum non conveniens.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-base">18.2 – Waiver by Jury Trial</h2>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h2 class="text-base">18.3 – Arbitration</h2>
            <p>
            At TOM MARKETPLACE’s sole discretion and election, we may require you to refer any Disputes arising from these Terms or use of the Services, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, to be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Seychelles Court. And the language of the arbitration shall be English.
