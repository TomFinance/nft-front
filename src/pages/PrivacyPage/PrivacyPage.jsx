            <p>
            Sometimes, our use of your personal information is for purposes which are ancillary to the provision of the Website, or which are desirable in order to make it operate more effectively. In those circumstances, we believe we have a legitimate interest in handling your data, and do not believe that this storage and use of your data will be of particular concern to you.

            <p>
            You can opt-out at any point by clicking “Unsubscribe” in any email communication you receive, which means you will no longer receive these marketing messages.

            </p>
            <p>
            We use third parties to help us manage your information and the Website, such as our IT service providers, cloud service providers and customer service software and support ticketing providers. These are companies who are authorised to process data on our behalf only as necessary to provide the relevant services to us and cannot use it for their own independent purposes;<br/>
            We may share your data with third-party wallet providers or payment processors to complete any purchases on the Website. As may be necessary, these third-party payment processors may also ask us to share your data with them to confirm the nature of any payment transaction and to verify your identity and payment details;<br/>
            We share your personal information with companies that assist us with our marketing activities where you have opted-in for such communications; and<br/>
            We or our third-party partners may disclose your personal information where we are required or permitted to do so by law or to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of any third party. We may also share your data with third parties to prevent fraud, abusive or unlawful behavior or to demonstrate our compliance with other terms or laws.<br/>
            Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us. We will always take reasonable steps to ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
            </p>
            <p>
            We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:
            </p>
            <p>
            where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business, such as:<br/>
            if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets;<br/>
            if substantially all of our or any of our affiliates' assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be one of the transferred assets;<br/>
            if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity;<br/>
            in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Service or any other agreement or terms of use, to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity; or<br/>
            to protect the rights, property or safety of TOM Marketplace, our staff, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.<br/>
            We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.
            </p>
            <p>
            Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party without notifying you and, where necessary, obtaining your consent. If you have given your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but later change your mind, you should contact us and we will stop doing so.
            </p> 

            <h2 class="text-base">5 - THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COMPANIES</h2>
            <p>
            We want to make sure that our advertising and marketing are relevant and interesting to you and our other users.
            </p>
            <p>
            To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated data to assist in serving ads when you visit or use the Website. This includes third party technology companies which collect data about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use the Website. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use the Website in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we share data with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics which we use to analyse your use of the Website. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.
            </p>
            <p>
            These third party advertising companies collect, store and use data by integrating cookies and other tracking software on the Website. The relevant data collected by these third parties may include website activity (for example, how long you are accessing our website and which specific pages you have looked at), IP addresses, and geolocation information. Data which you provide to TOM Marketplace when using the Website may also be captured by these third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
            In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.
            </p>
            <p>
            Please see our Cookies Policy for more information on the third party advertising companies which collect, use and store data about you, the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our Services and how you can amend your cookies setting in your browser settings.

            <p>
            We engage the services of a cloud storage provider in providing the Website. This means that the personal information we collect from you might be used, stored and/or accessed by our staff, members of our group, or suppliers outside of Seychelles, such as in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the USA, Canada, Asia Pacific, and other locations where our provider has servers. Further details on to whom your personal information may be disclosed are set out in section 4 (What personal information is shared with or accessed by third parties?).

These measures may include the following permitted in Articles 45 and 46 of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation:
            </p>
            <p>
            in the case of USA based entities, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them;
            </p>
            <p>
            in the case of Canada based entities, relying on the European Commission's determination that Canadian law provides adequate protection for such personal information; and
            </p>
            <p>
            in the case of entities based in other countries outside the EEA, entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with them.

Further, you agree, acknowledge and consent that your personal information (and such other personal information which you provide to us) may be stored or processed in any country where we have operations or where we engage service providers. We may transfer personal information outside Seychelles to countries which may have data protection rules that are different from those of Seychelles. However, we shall take measures to ensure that any such transfers comply with the local law, and such personal information remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access the personal information.
